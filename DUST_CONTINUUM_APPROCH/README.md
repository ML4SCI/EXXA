# Planet detection from dust continuum images of protoplanetary disk


This project aims to train machine learning models to detect protoplanets forming inside protoplanetary disks. It will use simulated dust continuum images of protoplanetary disks for training. 
\
\
The `Fargo3d_files` contains a setup designed to simulate dust and gas density distribution of protoplanetary disks with planets using hydrodynamical simulation code [FARGO3d](https://fargo3d.bitbucket.io/download.html). It also contains some simulation results and utiliy functions to generate FARGO3d setup parameter files and visualize the outputs.
\
The `fargo2radmc3d_files` contains fargo2radmc3d runner which uses dust density distributions generated by FARGO3d and converts it into RADMC3d compatible inputs and uses RADMC3d to perform radiative transfer simulation.

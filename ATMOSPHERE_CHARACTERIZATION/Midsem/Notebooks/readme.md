Unsupervised and Supervised Methods</br>
</h1>

This folder contains the notebooks used for implementing both unsupervised and supervised ML models.

For the unsupervised case, I applied dimensionality reduction and clustering methods. Clustering methods will be helpful to get clusters which can constrain the gas components impacting the observed spectra.

For the supervised case, I tried implementing two simple neural networks.The datset used contained 269 features and six labels for the regression task.
I implemented a simple 1D CNN and a simple LSTM using Tensorflow and Keras.

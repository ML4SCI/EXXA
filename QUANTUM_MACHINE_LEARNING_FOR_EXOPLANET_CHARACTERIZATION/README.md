This repository contains all contributions towards the EXXA project - QML for Exoplanet Characterization , as part of Google Summer of Code 2025 under the ML4SCI organisation.
```

### Google Summer of Code(GSoC):

Google Summer of Code is a global, online program focused on bringing new contributors into open source software development. GSoC Contributors work with an open source organization on a 12+ week programming project under the guidance of mentors, gaining hands-on experience while helping strengthen open source communities. GSoC aims to inspire long-term involvement and bring fresh talent into the open source ecosystem.

## Project Goal:

The goal of this project is to explore the use of quantum machine learning (QML) techniques to aid in the characterization of exoplanetary atmospheres from transmission spectra.Â It aims to evaluate how effectively quantum representations capture physical or chemical structure in the data and detect anomalies that could signal unique or potentially habitable planetary conditions.
